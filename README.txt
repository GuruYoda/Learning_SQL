This project is an attempt to leanrn SQL basics

I have also implemented SQL using SQLite Python library
to solve some problems that were intresting for me

Current status of the projects:
1) The first project is an implementation to read the data about the
e-mails form some users anf work on the large text fiel to parse the data 
and create an SQL database out of it.

2) The second deals with the XML files generated from my i-tunes
The objective was to come up with a logical data model and implement 
it using SQLite and python to quickly access the data and generate a 
Relational database model
